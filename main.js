//32.Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
//• Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
//• Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
//• Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.
//• Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.
//current users array
var current_users = ["Aslam", "usama", "taboo", "sadaf", "hamza"];
//current users array
var new_users = ["usama", "laiba", "areeba", "mani", "hamza"];
//loop through new_users to chech for usernames availability
new_users.forEach(function (new_one_user) {
    //making a condition for username already exist and save in our_condition variable
    var our_condition = current_users.some(function (current_one_user) { return current_one_user.toLowerCase() === new_one_user.toLocaleLowerCase(); });
    //print different message using if else statement
    if (our_condition) {
        console.log("Sorry ".concat(new_one_user, " is already taken!"));
    }
    else {
        console.log("This username ".concat(new_one_user, " is available"));
    }
});
